## Problems Addressed
* Finding cheap gas prices while on a road trip is challenging if you don't have a gasbuddy app.
* Knowing the best local restaurants is tough when you are passing through a city, which leads to people usually eating from unhealthy fast food chains when road tripping.


<a name="goal"></a>
## Primary Goal
* Google Maps and Apple Maps are helpful when you need to search food around you, but what about finding the best local food in your next pit stop 3 hours away? We wanted to help road trippers be able to plan ahead for these pit stops by enabling them to scout out the best local food options and cheapest gas prices at each stage of their journey.
