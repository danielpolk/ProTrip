# ProTrip

## Target Audience
* ProTrip is the perfect road trip companion. It is designed to be on the go for people travelling between cities. Our goal is to make every pit stop count, by giving the user the tastiest local food options, cheapest gas prices, and best events at each of their pit stops.

## Primary Goal
* Google Maps and Yelp are helpful when you need to search food around you, but what about finding the best local food in your next pit stop 3 hours away? ProTrip is your one stop shop. No more switching between apps. We wanted to help road trippers be able to plan ahead for these pit stops by enabling them to scout out the best local food options, cheapest gas prices, and best events at each stage of their journey.

## Problems Addressed
* Finding cheap gas prices while on a road trip is challenging if you don't have a gasbuddy app.
* Knowing the best local restaurants is tough when you are passing through a city, which leads to people usually eating from unhealthy fast food chains when road tripping.
* Being aware of events happening in that city you are passing through requires a lot of planning. We wanted to make the user aware of all of these options with just a click.

## Easy as 1, 2, 3
* Tell us where you're going.
